Charity's website for GRA494: Front-End Design and Development

If one file has been changed in more than one branch, attempting to merge those branches will cause a conflict in that file. This is because the branches have diverged from one another. Had the file only had changes in the new branch, git whould see these changes as a continuation of master. It then would have been able to "Fast-forward" and would not have created a conflict.
