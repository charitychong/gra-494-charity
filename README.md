## Changes to one file in two branches

		When merging two branches with git, git attempts to reconcile the differences in the files on its own. When it is unable to do so, it flags the significant differences between changed files as conflicts. It is up to you or the person managing the repo to manually correct these conflicts before the merge can be completed.# gra-494-charity
